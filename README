This plugin is for the first prototype: it's fully functional within the limitations and commands explained in the config file, though I'll be updating it continuously, mainly with aesthetics.
The plugin is the uncompiled version of what will be put in the server's addons/sourcemod/plugins folder. The config file is an example of the commands the node server might enter through rcon upon starting a match.
